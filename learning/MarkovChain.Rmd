### Notations and Definitions 

* a stochastic process $\left \{ X_{n},n=0,1,2,... \right \}$ takes on a finite/countable number of 
possible values (nonnegative integers, $X_n \in \mathbb{Z}_+$). $X_{n}=i$ means the process is in state $i$ at time $n$.
all possible values => **State Space**
* **Markov Property**: $P_{ij} = P[X_{n+1} = j | X_n = i_n, X_{n-1} = i_{n-1}, \ldots, X_0 = i_0] = P[X_{n+1} = j | X_n = i_n] \hspace{.2in} \forall i, j \in \mathbb{Z}_+$
* **Markov Chain**: a stochastic process with the above Markov Property
* $P_{ij}$: 1-step **transition probability**
    + $P_{ij} \geq 0, \hspace{.2in} \forall i,j \geq 0$
    + $\sum_{j \geq 0} P_{ij} = 1, \hspace{.2in} i = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$
    + n-step transition probability: $P_{ij}^n = P[X_{n+k} = j | X_k = i] \hspace{.2in} \forall n \geq 0, \hspace{.2in} i,j \geq 0$
* **Initial State**
* **Transition Matrix**

### Example-1 

ref: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/markovchain/vignettes/an_introduction_to_markovchain_package.pdf

```{r}
library(markovchain)
# markovchain objects
mcWeather <- new("markovchain",
                 states = c("sunny", "cloudy", "rain"),
                 transitionMatrix = matrix(data = c(0.70, 0.2,0.1,
                                                    0.3,0.4, 0.3,
                                                    0.2,0.45,0.35),
                                           byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3),
                 name = "Weather")
show(mcWeather)
plot(mcWeather)

# transition probability from A to B
transitionProbability(mcWeather, "cloudy", "rain")

# conditional probability
conditionalDistribution(mcWeather, "sunny")


# dataframe<->markovchain object
mcDf <- as(mcWeather, "data.frame")
mcNew <- as(mcDf, "markovchain")

# initial state
initialState <- c(0,1,0)
after2Days <- initialState * (mcWeather * mcWeather)
after2Days
after7Days <- initialState * (mcWeather^7)
after7Days

# stady state
steadyStates(mcWeather)
```

### Example-2:  Simulation and Prediction 

#### simulate a series of observations:

```{r}
weathersOfDays <- rmarkovchain(n = 365, object = mcWeather, t0 = "sunny")
weathersOfDays[1:30]
```

#### estimate/fit a markov chain from the given data:

there are three methods to do the estimation: 
maximum likelihood, maximum likelihood with laplace smoothing, bootstrap

```{r}
weatherFittedMLE <- markovchainFit(data = weathersOfDays, method = "mle", name = "Weather MLE")
weatherFittedMLE$estimate
```

Both MLE and Laplace approach are based on **createSequenceMatrix** function that converts the data sequence into a contigency table:

```{r}
createSequenceMatrix(stringchar = weathersOfDays)
```

#### making predictions:

* predicting from a markov object
```{r}
# markov object is the one we estimated;
# assuming last two days were: "cloudy","sunny" respectively
# making prediction for the following three observations
predict(object = weatherFittedMLE$estimate, newdata = c("cloudy","sunny"),n.ahead = 3)
```
